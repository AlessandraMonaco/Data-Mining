# FEATURE ENGINEERING FOR CLUSTERING HOUSES

## Introduction
The goal of this notebook is to understand the impact of the **Feature engineering** process on the effectiveness of K-Means clustering.
We will first cluster data as they are, and then we will try to apply some Feature engineering techniques in order to build more reasonable clusters.

## Dataset
The dataset that we used is the famous California House Pricing, available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices).
